🦇 TheBatSonar: Project Overview

📌 Introduction

TheBatSonar is an AI-powered browser extension designed to filter out toxic, distracting, and misleading content from social media feeds. Unlike traditional keyword-based blockers, it uses advanced NLP and LLMs to understand the context of posts, ensuring users are shielded from unwanted content without losing access to meaningful discussions.

🎯 Key Features

✅ AI-Driven Context Filtering → Blocks posts based on sentiment, toxicity, and relevance rather than just keywords.
✅ Customizable Content Filters → Users can define categories they want to avoid, such as "drama," "negativity," "clickbait," or "crypto FUD."
✅ Real-Time Processing → Works seamlessly in the browser, analyzing content on Facebook, Twitter/X, YouTube, Reddit, and more.
✅ Privacy-Focused → No user data is stored; all filtering happens locally or via secure APIs.
✅ Smart Trend Alerts (Optional) → Allows users to track important discussions while filtering out emotionally charged content.
